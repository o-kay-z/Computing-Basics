        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Relatively new, computer science has developed a variety of scientific disciplines and research methodologies, notably in solving computational models and algorithms.  It is the study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information. A key question in the field is what can be automated efficiently?

            Historically, computers only focused on computation of numbers and data processing, however it soon expanded to include the computer and it’s surroundings. It was more than just programming, it was involved in the computer system’s structure and operation, principle of design, programming methods, and theoretical aspects of computing.

        <p>      Additionally, Computer Science extends to other fields in order to assist them.  Two strong relationship it has is with Mathematics and Engineering, both of which were deeply involved in its foundation. Numerous challenges in these fields were solved with the use of computers.
 
            Computer Science has become ever more relevant as it  branches out in the common lives of people. Being integral in addressing complex problems found in physics, chemistry, and astrology.  Other fields such as library science, management sience, economics, medicine, forensics, linguistics, use computers for practical and innovative purposes. </p>
