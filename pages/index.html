        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Relatively new, computer science has developed a variety of scientific disciplines and research methodologies, notably in solving computational models and algorithms.  It is the study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information. A key question in the field is what can be automated efficiently?

            Historically, computers only focused on computation of numbers and data processing, however it soon expanded to include the computer and it’s surroundings. It was more than just programming, it was involved in the computer system’s structure and operation, principle of design, programming methods, and theoretical aspects of computing.

        <h2>Computer Science as a Discipline</h2>
        <img src="../assets/images/compsci.jpg">
        <p>      Additionally, Computer Science extends to other fields in order to assist them.  Two strong relationship it has is with Mathematics and Engineering, both of which were deeply involved in its foundation. Numerous challenges in these fields were solved with the use of computers.
 
            Computer Science has become ever more relevant as it  branches out in the common lives of people. Being integral in addressing complex problems found in physics, chemistry, and astrology.  Other fields such as library science, management sience, economics, medicine, forensics, linguistics, use computers for practical and innovative purposes. </p>

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p class="desc"> 
                Computer Science concerns itself with the theory, design, development,  and application through application technologies,  software methods and technology, and system infrastructure.
                It excludes itself from hardware and organizational needs. They create (but not deploy) operating systems, communications programs, web browsers, databases, search engines, etc.

            <h3>Information Technology</h3>
            <p class="desc"> 
                Information Technology (IT) focuses on applying technology in organizations/businesses tailored to their goals and its people. IT professionals implement, maintain, and manage computer systems, networks, databases, and software applications to ensure information systems function effectively to meet business needs. 
                This field specializes in technical operations like system administration, network management, security, and user support, addressing practical issues companies face with current technology

            <h3>Information System</h3>
            <p class="desc"> 
                It deals with the connection between information systems and the organization. This major comprehends everything, starting from principles and theory and finishing off with application and development. 
                Most systems developed and used by enterprise-information processing specialists integrate other suppliers’ software products to meet their organizations’ information requirements.
