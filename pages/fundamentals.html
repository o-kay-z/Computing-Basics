        <h2>Data</h2>

            <p> 
                Data is the factual information gained from statistics that is used to assess a decision about a specific
                action. Data can be numbers, characters, images or others. We use these data as a basis for rationalization,
                discussion, or calculation. It can be either Qualitative or Quantitative. The former being in verbal or
                narrative format whereas Quantitative is numerical. Examples for each are as follows:

                Information is when the data is then used to analyze and interpret given the context. It is structured and
                has been processed in order for the researcher or analyst to acquire ideas that is helpful to their decision
                making.

        <h2>Number Systems</h2>
            <p> 
                Number Systems are how numbers and digits are organized and process inside computers. The latter uses binary
                numbers (0s and 1s) to handle the things we save, input, or retrieve from the computer’s memory. Every thing
                such as audio, graphics, video, texts, and numbers follow a specific number system 
            </p>

            <h3>Decimal (Base 10)</h2>
                <p> 
                    It is from the Latin word “decem” meaning 10, containing 10 digits ranging from 0 to 9. 
                    It is easy to use and understand thus, majority of the population uses this number system. 
                    This number system is universal for counting, mathematics, currency, measurements, etc.
                </p>

            <h3>Binary (Base 2)</h2>
                <p> 
                    From the Latin word “binarius” meaning containing or consisting of two things. It contains only 2 digits consisting of 1 (on) and 0 (off), typically used by digital computers
                    The 2 digits corresponds to state of computer’s electrical circuits. All types of data can be represented and computed through binary, such use Boolean Logic (AND, OR, NOT) for decision making.

            <h3>Octal (Base 8)</h2>
                <p> 
                    From the Latin word “octo” meaning 8, containing 8 digits ranging 0 to 7.
                    One octal digit is equivalent to three binary digits. This numer system is used by computer programmers.

                    It simplifies long binary numbers (ex. 11010101 = 325) and because of it, it reduces human errors.
                    In early computing, it was used more often for simpler writing and understanding compared to binary.

            <h3>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</h2>
                <p> 
                    From the Latin word “hexa” meaning six and “decem”, contains 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
                    Note that the values of 10 to 15 are represented as letters instead.
                    Like octal, it simplifies long binary numbers, but moreso (ex. 1010111111 = 2BF). One hexadecimal digit is equivalent to four binary digits.
                    This number system is used by computer programmers as well for addressing memory locations, representing colors, low level programming, and
                    debugging.

        <h2> Information Systems</h2>
            <p> 
                Information Systems are a collection of connected parts that gathers information so that it that can be
                manipulated, stored, distributed, and improve an organization’s flow through feedback. It involves the
                technology (the hardware, software, telecommunications), structure(relationship between a person to
                components), people(the individuals the system is directly involved), and lastly process (important
                activities to produce the goods and services oo=f the organization). 
            </p>

            <h3>Executive Support System (ESS)</h2>
                <p>
                    This system is completely unstructured in order to make highly important and exceptional decisions.
                    It acquires information from the systems below as well as systems of the company’s competitors. It
                    analyzes business trends and predicts forecast.

            <h3>Decisions Support System (DSS)</h2>
                <p> 
                    This system uses information from MIS and TPS in order to analyze data and make decisions on what
                    changes are needed. It attempts to answer hypothetical questions that impact the organization’s
                    efficiency and profits. It addresses odd and dynamic issues that have no predefined procedure thus
                    it is semi-structured.

            <h3>Management Information System (MIS)</h2>
                <p> 
                    This is for the managers to oversee, control, administrational tasks and make decisions using the
                    data from TPS. It questions if everything is working correctly by viewing the data in reports.
                </p>

            <h3>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h2>
                <p> 
                    The system that records daily operations such as recording sales, purchases, payments, employee
                    records, salary, shipping, accounting, and treasury. The system is used mainly to monitor
                    transaction flow and is predefined and highly structured
