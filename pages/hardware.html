        <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p> 
                It is the physical components of a computer system. These are the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage,
                terminals and printers. It accepts data through input devices, process it and produce information through output devices that can be
                stored for later use.

                <p> 
                    The process of feeding data, commands, or signals into a computer system, allowing it to perform tasks,
                    interpret information, and respond to what the user wants. It enables the user to communicate with the computer by sending signals to the CPU, 
                    which then processes the information and produces an appropriate response. Without it, computers would just like be a TV and would lack interaction.

            <h2>Output</h2>
            <img>
                <p> 
                    Refers to an instance of a computer program that is actively being executed by one or more threads,
                    containing both the program code and its operations. Performing arithmetic and logical operations is also known as processing.
                    The Central Processing Unit (CPU), also called the processor or microprocessor, is essential for
                    managing and executing instructions and calculations. This allows the computer to perform its functions
                    effectively.

            <img>
                <p> 
                    Refers to the data generated by a computer after processing and calculating, which can be presented
                    either digitally or physically. It provides users with the results of data that has been processed into useful information, 
                    allowing them to interpret and act on it. It plays a crucial role by displaying or producing this information externally, 
                    making it accessible and usable.

            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <img>
                <p> 
                    Allows data and instructions to be remembered over time. It ensures that data and instructions are available when needed for processing or retrieval.
                    It can be temporary, like Random Access Memory (RAM), which holds data for quick access while a program is
                    running or permanent, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSS), where data is saved long-term, even
                    after the computer is turned off. It is essential for the computer’s operation, making sure that everything is running from running applications to preserving files and media.

            <h2>Motherboards</h2>
                <p>
                    The mother board consists of power and data connectors, capacitors, heat sinks, and fans. 
                    It typically is made of fiberglass and copper. 
                    <br><br>The 12 key components are:

                    Form Factor - refers to the size, shape, and physical specifications of hardware components. It is crucial for maintaining connection compatibility within a computer system.
                    <br><br>
                    Central Processing Unit (CPU) - the primary component of a computer, often referred to as the "brain" of the machine. It processes and executes instructions from software, controlling the flow of data and enabling the computer to perform tasks. The CPU Slots/Socket connects a it to the motherboard using pins.
                    <br><br>
                    Random Access Memory (RAM) - stores and quickly accesses data making it enhance  computer performance. The Memory Slots ( aka RAM/DIMM slots) holds and connects the motherboard and  RAM modules.
                    <br><br>
                    Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) -  loads the operating system and is an essential firmware that bridges hardware and software. It starts and tests hardware components when a computer is turned on. 
                    <br><br>
                    Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) - connects a device to allow hardware components like network cards, sound cards, and modems to be attached to a computer.  Peripheral Component Interconnect Expresss (PCIe) provides better performance and bandwidth for components that are connected.
                    <br><br>
                    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) - a technology used to connect storage devices (hard drives & SSDs) to a computer's motherboard. Data is transferred faster through transferring data one bit at a time over a single line.
