            <p> 
                It is the physical components of a computer system. These are the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage,
                terminals and printers. It accepts data through input devices, process it and produce information through output devices that can be
                stored for later use.

                    The process of feeding data, commands, or signals into a computer system, allowing it to perform tasks,
                    interpret information, and respond to what the user wants. It enables the user to communicate with the computer by sending signals to the CPU, 
                    which then processes the information and produces an appropriate response. Without it, computers would just like be a TV and would lack interaction.

            <h2>Output</h2>

                <p> 
                    Refers to an instance of a computer program that is actively being executed by one or more threads,
                    containing both the program code and its operations. Performing arithmetic and logical operations is also known as processing.
                    The Central Processing Unit (CPU), also called the processor or microprocessor, is essential for
                    managing and executing instructions and calculations. This allows the computer to perform its functions
                    effectively.

                    Refers to the data generated by a computer after processing and calculating, which can be presented
                    either digitally or physically. It provides users with the results of data that has been processed into useful information, 
                    allowing them to interpret and act on it. It plays a crucial role by displaying or producing this information externally, 
                    making it accessible and usable.

                    Allows data and instructions to be remembered over time. It ensures that data and instructions are available when needed for processing or retrieval.
                    It can be temporary, like Random Access Memory (RAM), which holds data for quick access while a program is
                    running or permanent, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSS), where data is saved long-term, even
                    after the computer is turned off. It is essential for the computerâ€™s operation, making sure that everything is running from running applications to preserving files and media.
