            <p> 
                Software controls the information and operation in the computer. 
                It consists of programs (Application Software/System Software) that allow a computer to carry out specific tasks, 
                distinguishing it from the physical parts of the system, known as hardware. 
                To ensure the smooth operation of a data processing system, it includes together a set of instructions, procedures, algorithms, and related documentation.
                Software makes it possible for users to accomplish a wide range of tasks, from basic calculations to complex data analysis.
