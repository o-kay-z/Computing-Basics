        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>Controls the information and operation in the computer.

            Consists of programs (Application Software/System Software) that allow a computer to carry out specific
            tasks, distinguishing it from the physical parts of the system, known as hardware

            Includes a set of instructions, procedures, algorithms, and related documentation that together ensure the
            smooth operation of a data processing system

            Software makes it possible for users to accomplish a wide range of tasks, from basic calculations to complex
            data analysis</p>

            <h2>Application Software</h2>
            <p> Used to solve a particular problem or to perform a particular task
                Applied by users to do real-world task
                E.g. keep track of inventory, design a car engine, draft minutes for meeting, play games.
                May either be custom-designed or packaged </p>

            <h2>System Software</h2>
            <p> manages and supports the operation of a computer system, often interacting directly with hardware.
                Includes operating systems, hardware drivers, and programming languages, which are typically not of
                concern to regular end-users. </p>

        <h2>Implementation in Communities</h2>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p> Computer-Based Education (CBE) is implemented in order for allow institutions and teachers to control,
            deliver, and evaluate the studentâ€™s learning. It helps institutions track and analyze student performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
        <p> Used for patient record-keeping, diagnostics, and medical procedures, including monitoring systems, lab
            diagnostics, and surgeries. (Electronic Health Record Software) </p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p> Computers are used for Email, chatting, Usenet, FTP, Telnet, and video conferencing. </p>

        <h3>Insurance</h3>
        <p> Insurance companies use computers to maintain up-to-date records of clients, such as start dates, due
            installments, maturity dates, interest, survival benefits, and bonuses. (AMS/PMS) </p>

        <h3>Engineering</h3>
        <p> Computer-Aided Design (CAD) used in various engineering fields, including structural engineering for stress
            and strain analysis, industrial engineering for system design and improvement, and architectural engineering
            for town planning and building design using 2D and 3D drawings. </p>

        <h3>Government</h3>
        <p> Computers are used for budgeting, sales and income tax departments, gender ratio calculations, voter list
            management, PAN card issuance, and weather forecasting. (PMS) </p>

        <h3>Military</h3>
        <p> Computers are heavily used in defense for controlling modern tanks, missiles, weapons, and military systems.
            Examples: missile control, military communication, operation and planning, and smart weapons communication.
        </p>
