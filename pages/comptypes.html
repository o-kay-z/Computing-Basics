        <h2>Computer Types</h2>
            <p> 
                Different types of computers exist because each is designed to meet specific needs and tasks. Some, like the
                familiar personal computers, are made for general use, while others like the supercomputer, are designed for
                complex calculations and scientific research. The variety allows for more efficient performance,
                cost-effectiveness, and adaptability across different industries and user needs.

                Understanding the different types of computers is important because it helps users choose the right device
                for their specific needs. It aids in performance optimization, making sure of security, and effective
                resources management. Additionally, it helps in understanding how technology fits into larger systems and
                industries.

        <h3>Processing Speed</h3>
            <p> 
                Servers have the highest processing speed. They are designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and
                process large amounts of data. Secondly, Workstations also feature high processing speeds, optimized for
                resource-intensive tasks like 3D rendering and scientific calculations but not greater than servers. Mini
                computers offer moderate processing speeds, making them suitable for medium-sized tasks. Micro computers are
                the slowest, primarily designed for general personal or office tasks that donâ€™t need significant processing
                power.
            </p>

        <h3>Memory Capacity</h3>
            <p> 
                Servers have the largest memory capacity in order for them to manage large databases and support many users
                at once. It is then followed by Workstations that handle memory-heavy professional applications. Mini
                computers meanwhile have moderate memory capacities for smaller-scale operations. Lastly, Micro computers
                have the smallest memory capacity just enough for basic tasks like browsing, emailing, and office work.
            </p>

        <h3>Power Consumption</h3>
            <p> 
                Designed for energy efficiency, Micro computers consume the least amount of power. Mini computers consume
                more power than micro computers, but still less than workstations or servers. Workstations have higher power
                consumption because of the powerful components needed for specialized tasks. Servers have the highest power
                consumption as they operate continuously.
            </p>

        <h3>Minimum and Usage</h3>
            <p> 
                Servers are primarily used in large businesses, data centers, and web hosting environments. Meanwhile
                Workstations are used in specialized fields like graphic design, engineering, and research. Mini computers
                are usually used in medium-sized businesses or departments where moderate computing power is needed. And
                finally, Micro computers are used for personal computing tasks, such as browsing the internet, word
                processing, and light office work.
