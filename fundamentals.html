        <h2>Data</h2>
        <img>
        <p> Data is the  factual information gained from statistics that  is used to assess a decision about a specific action. Data can be numbers, characters, images or others. We use these data as a basis for rationalization, discussion, or calculation. It can be either Qualitative or Quantitative. The former being in verbal or narrative format whereas Quantitative is numerical. Examples for each are as follows: </p>

        <h2>Information</h2>
        <img>
        <p> Information is when the data is then used to analyze and interpret given the context. It is structured and has been processed in order for the researcher or analyst to acquire ideas that is helpful to their decision making.  </p>

        <h2>Number Systems</h2>
        <p> Number Systems are how numbers and digits are organized and process inside computers. The latter uses binary numbers (0s and 1s) to handle the things we save, input, or retrieve from the computer’s memory. Every thing such as audio, graphics, video, texts, and numbers follow a specific number system </p>

            <h3>Decimal (Base 10)</h2>
                <p>From the Latin word “decem” meaning 10. Majority of the population uses this number system.               Contains 10 digits ranging from 0 to 9.
                    
                    Significance
                    Is the universal number system for counting, mathematics, currency, measurements, etc.
                    Easy to use and understand</p>

            <h3>Binary (Base 2)</h2>
                <p>From the Latin word “binarius” meaning Containing or consisting of two things
                    Contains only 2 digits consisting of 1 (on) and 0 (off)
                    Used by digital computers
                    
                    Significance
                    The 2 digits corresponds to state of computer’s electrical circuits
                    All types of data can be represented through binary
                    Can use Boolean Logic (AND, OR, NOT) for decision making</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Octal (Base 8)</h2>
                <p>From the Latin word “octo” meaning 8
                    Contains 8 digits ranging 0 to 7
                    One octal digit is equivalent to three binary digits
                    Used by computer programmers
                    
                    Significance
                    Simplifies long binary numbers (ex. 11010101 = 325)
                    In early computing, it was used more often for simpler writing and understanding compared to binary
                    Reduces human errors
                    </p>
        </article>

            <h3>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</h2>
                <p>From the Latin word “hexa” meaning six and “decem” 
                    Contains only 16 digits: 0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
                    Values 10-15 are letters instead
                    One hexadecimal digit is equivalent to four binary digits
                    Used by computer programmers as well
                    
                    Significance
                    Like octal, it simplifies long binary numbers but moreso (ex. 1010111111 = 2BF)
                    Commonly used for addressing memory locations, representing  colors, low level programming, and debugging</p>

        <h2> Information Systems</h2>
        <p>  Information System is a collection of connected parts that gathers information so that it that can be manipulated, stored, distributed, and improve an organization’s flow through feedback. It involves the technology(the hardware, software, telecommunications), structure(relationship between a person to components) , people(the individuals the system is directly involved), and lastly process (important activities to produce the goods and services oo=f the organization) . </p>

            <h3>Executive Support System (ESS)</h2>
                <p>This system is completely unstructured in order to make highly important and exceptional decisions. It acquires information from the systems below as well as systems of the company’s competitors. It analyzes business trends and predicts forecast.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Decisions Support System (DSS)</h2>
                <p>This system uses information from MIS and TPS in order to analyze data and make decisions on what changes are needed.  It attempts to answer hypothetical questions that impact the organization’s efficiency and profits. It addresses odd and dynamic issues that have no predefined procedure thus it is semi-structured.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Management Information System (MIS)</h2>
                <p>This is for the managers to oversee, control, administrational tasks and make decisions using the data from TPS. It questions if everything is working correctly by viewing the data in reports.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h2>
                <p>The system  that  records daily operations such as recording sales, purchases, payments, employee records, salary, shipping, accounting, and treasury. The system is used mainly to monitor transaction flow and is predefined and highly structured</p>
